# Hyperpar
R scripts and data for hyper-parameter estimation in high-dimensional (generalized) linear models

1. Download HyperparEst_Master.R file
2. Download SourceAndDataFiles, preferrably in same directory as the HyperparEst_Master.R file.
3. Open HyperparEst_Master.R file in R (preferrably >=3.5.0), installed required packages and run code. 

Code should reproduce figures in the corresponding paper:

Jurre R. Veerman, Gwenael G.R. Leday, Mark A. van de Wiel (2019),"Estimation of variance components, 
heritability and the ridge penalty in high-dimensional generalized linear models". Submitted.

Results folder contains all results as .Rdata files, as obtained by the authors.
